# Personal Website

I built this website using Python and Django for the back end, and HTML and CSS for the front end. I was able to put it together in a couple of weekends to get familiar with Django, which I had not previously used, and deploy the site using [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/).
